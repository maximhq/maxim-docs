title: Generate and translate product descriptions with AI
description: Build an AI workflow to generate product descriptions from images using Prompt Chains
---

Let's take a scenario where you have an application in which you want to build an AI workflow that generates a product description from a product image. Now, if you want to add more functionalities like translation, data processing, or sending data to external services, you would have to create a separate translation service, write additional code, and build an API layer to communicate with those external services.

This is exactly where Maxim [Prompt Chains](/evaluate/how-to/evaluate-chains/experiment-with-prompt-chains) can help you build the workflow, covering all these pieces. With different types of nodes, you can create the same functionality with ease. Let's go through it step by step.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Product Description Generator">

Create a new [Prompt](/evaluate/how-to/evaluate-prompts/experiment-in-prompt-playground) with these system instructions:

```plaintext System instructions for product description generator
You are a highly skilled AI that generates compelling product descriptions. Your goal is to highlight key features, benefits, and unique selling points in an engaging and brand-aligned tone.

Guidelines:

- Understand the Product: Focus on essential attributes and appeal to the target audience.
- Tone & Style: Adapt based on the brand (e.g., luxury, casual, tech-savvy).
- SEO & Readability: Use relevant keywords naturally, keep it concise, and structure for easy reading.
- Persuasive & Action-Driven: Highlight USPs and include a strong call to action.

Ensure descriptions are clear, engaging, and tailored to different product categories.
```

</Step>

<Step title="Add the Prompt to a chain">

Create a [Prompt chain](/evaluate/how-to/evaluate-chains/experiment-with-prompt-chains) and add your product description generator Prompt as the first step.

</Step>

<Step title="Add translation support">

Add another AI node to translate the generated product description:

1. Connect it after the product description generator Prompt
2. Configure it to translate the product description output
3. Choose your target languages

</Step>

<Step title="Process translations with code block node">

Add a Code block node to handle translated product descriptions:

1. Split text by language
2. Structure output as key-value pairs

</Step>

<Step title="Connect logging service">

Add an API node to integrate with external systems:

- Log results
- Send notifications
- Connect to analytics
- Trigger actions in other tools

[Configure](/evaluate/how-to/evaluate-chains/use-api-nodes-within-chains) your endpoint details and required payload format.
