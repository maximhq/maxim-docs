title: Re-use your test configurations using presets
description: As your team starts running tests regularly on your entities, make it simple and quick to configure tests and see results. Test presets are a way to help you reuse your configurations with a single click, reducing the time it takes to start a run. You can create labeled presets combining a dataset and evaluators and use them with any entity you want to test.
