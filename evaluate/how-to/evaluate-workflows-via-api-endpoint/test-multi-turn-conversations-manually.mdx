## Why do we need to test multi-turn conversations?

Real conversations create fascinating puzzles because:

- Testing single responses doesn't reveal the complete interaction pattern
- Just like human conversations, AI chats can take unexpected turns
- When something goes wrong, you need to replay the conversation - but what if you could change history?

These intriguing challenges make it crucial to test your AI's conversational abilities thoroughly before it faces real users. 
Maxim solves this with an interactive Messages panel that lets you simulate, manipulate, and debug multi-turn conversations in real-time. Bring your application endpoint to create and test multi-turn conversations without any code integration.

## Configure your endpoint

Before testing conversations, you need to configure your endpoint:

1. Enter your AI endpoint URL (e.g., `https://astronomy-ai.example.com/chat`)
2. Configure the request body
   ```json
   {
     "query": "{{input}}"
   }
   ```
   Your application receives and processes messages correctly with this configuration.

## Start a conversation

1. Type your initial message in the input field
2. Click Send to start the conversation

## Edit and modify conversations

You can manipulate the conversation to test different scenarios:

- **Delete Messages**: Remove any message from the conversation history to test how your AI handles modified contexts
- **Edit History**: Change previous messages to simulate different conversation paths

## Example usage

Here's a typical workflow for testing multi-turn conversations:

1. Start with a simple query:
   ```
   User: "How old is the universe?"
   AI: "The universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old..."
   ```

2. Follow up with related questions:
   ```
   User: "What's the Big Bang theory?"
   AI: "The Big Bang theory explains the origin of the universe..."
   ```

By using the Messages panel effectively, you can ensure your AI endpoint handles multi-turn conversations reliably and maintains appropriate context throughout the interaction.
