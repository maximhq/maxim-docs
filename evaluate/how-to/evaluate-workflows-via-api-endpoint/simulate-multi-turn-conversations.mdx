title: Simulate multi-turn conversations
description: Test your AI's conversational abilities with realistic, scenario-based simulations

## Why simulate conversations?

Testing AI conversations manually is time-consuming and often misses edge cases. It helps you:

- Test how your AI maintains context across multiple exchanges
- Evaluate responses to different user emotions and behaviors
- Verify proper use of business context and policies
- Identify potential conversation dead-ends

## 1. Create a realistic scenario and be specific about the situation you want to test

- Customer requesting refund for a defective laptop
- New user needs help configuring account security settings
- Customer confused about unexpected charges on their bill

## 2. Define the user persona

- Frustrated customer seeking refund
- New user needing security help
- Confused customer with billing issues

<Note>
Mix different emotional states and expertise levels to test how your agent adapts its communication style.
</Note>

After defining the user persona, select the field where your agent's replies come from:

## 3. Advanced settings (optional)

- **Maximum number of turns:** Set a limit for conversation turns. If no value's set, the simulation ends when complete
- **Reference tools**: Attach any tools you want to test with the simulation. You can learn more about setting up tools [here](/docs/library/how-to/prompt-tools/create-a-code-tool)
- **Reference context**: Add context sources to enhance conversations. Learn more [here](/docs/library/how-to/context-sources/bring-your-rag-via-an-api-endpoint)

## Example simulation

Here's a real-world example of a simulated conversation:

<Note>
This tests a refund scenario where:
- Customer needs refund for defective product
- Agent verifies purchase
- Policy guides the process
- Must resolve in 5 turns
