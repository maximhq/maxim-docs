## Getting Started with Local Testing

Want to evaluate your AI application but it's running locally? No problem! We'll help you connect your local AI app to Maxim for testing.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Your local AI Endpoint">
Create a simple Flask API that implements RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) - a technique that enhances AI responses with relevant context from your data:

```python title="Example Flask API for RAG implementation"
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/rag', methods=['POST'])
def rag_output():
    # Get the query from the request
    body = request.get_json()
    print(body)
    output = runPrompt(body['query'])
    response = {'response':output}
    return response

# main driver function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # run() method of Flask class runs the application
    # on the local development server.
    app.run()
```

This example shows a RAG application using Google's PaLM model with "Harry Potter" content. The endpoint runs at `http://localhost:5000/rag`.

</Step>

<Step title="Set up Ngrok">
To make your local API accessible to Maxim, we'll use Ngrok - a secure tunneling tool that creates a public URL for your local server.

Follow these steps on MacOS:

```bash title="Install and configure Ngrok"
# Install Ngrok
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok

# Set up your auth token (you'll need to sign up at ngrok.com)
ngrok config add-authtoken your_token

# Create a secure tunnel to your local server
ngrok http 5000
```

You can read about ngrok setup for other operating systems [here](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started).
</Step>

<Step title="Connect to Maxim">
Now that your API is accessible, let's connect it to Maxim:

1. Copy your Ngrok URL (looks like `https://xxxx-xx-xx-xxx-xx.ngrok.io`) and navigate to [Workflows](/docs/evaluate/how-to/evaluate-workflows-via-api-endpoint/test-your-ai-outputs-using-application-endpoint)
2. Add your Ngrok URL as the API endpoint
3. Start testing your AI responses

<Callout type="info">
Remember to keep both your Flask server and Ngrok running during testing. Once you stop Ngrok, you'll need a new URL for your next testing session.
