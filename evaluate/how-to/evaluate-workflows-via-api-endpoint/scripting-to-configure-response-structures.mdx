title: Transform API data with Workflow scripts
description: Customize your API requests and responses using Workflow scripts
---

Maxim Workflows provide powerful scripting capabilities to modify requests and responses. These scripts help you transform data, add authentication, and handle complex response structures.

<Note>Scripts are optional - you'll only need them when you want to modify your API's behavior.</Note>

## Request Modification
The `prescript` function runs before sending requests to your API. Use it to modify request parameters, add headers, or transform data.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript prescript
function prescript(request) {
	request.headers["Authorization"] = "Bearer your-token";

	request.data = {
		...JSON.parse(request.data || "{}"),
		timestamp: Date.now(),
	};

	return request;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Response Processing
The `postscriptV2` function processes API responses before displaying them. Use it to transform response data or extract specific fields:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript postscriptV2
function postscriptV2(response, request) {
	return {
		content: response.data.message,
		confidence: response.data.metadata?.confidence || 1.0,
	};
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Conversation Management
<Note>Simulation scripts only run for multi-turn conversations. They won't execute for single-turn tests.</Note>

Use these scripts to set up and clean up multi-turn conversation tests:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript simulation
function preSimulation() {
	return {
		sessionId: generateUUID(),
		startTime: Date.now(),
	};
}

function postSimulation() {
	return {
		status: "completed",
		endTime: Date.now(),
	};
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Available Libraries

<Note>
	You don't need to use `require` or `import` to use these modules in scripts. These are directly available in the script environment.
</Note>

- `axios`: Axios is a popular HTTP client library for JavaScript. It provides a simple API for making HTTP requests and supports various features like request and response interceptors, request cancellation, and automatic JSON parsing.
