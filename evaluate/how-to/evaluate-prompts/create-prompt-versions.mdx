title: Create and manage Prompt versions
description: As teams build their AI applications, a big part of experimentation is iterating on the prompt structure. In order to collaborate effectively and organize your changes clearly, Maxim allows prompt versioning and comparison runs across versions.

## Create prompt versions

A prompt version is a set of messages and configurations that is published to mark a particular state of the prompt. Versions are used to run tests, compare results and make deployments.

<Steps>

<Step>
If a prompt has changes that are not published, a badge showing `unpublished changes` will show near its name in the header.

</Step>

<Step>
To publish a version, click on the `publish version` button in the header and select which messages you want to add to this version. Optionally add a description for easy reference of other team members.

</Step>

<Step>
View recent versions by clicking on the arrow adjoining the `publish version` button and view the complete list using the button at the bottom of this list. Each version includes details about publisher and date of publishing for easy reference. Open any version by clicking on it.
