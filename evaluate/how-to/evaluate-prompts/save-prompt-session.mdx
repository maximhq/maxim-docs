title: Save and track Prompt experiments with sessions
description: Sessions act as a history by saving your prompt's complete state as you work. This allows you to experiment freely without fear of losing your progress.

## Create prompt sessions

- A session saves all parts of the playground state including variable values, conversation messages etc. When leaving without saving, you'll receive a prompt to save or discard changes.

- Save an ongoing session using the `save session` button in the prompt header. Unsaved sessions are marked with a red asterisk beside their name. Each saved session includes a timestamp and creator details.

- View the list of recent sessions by clicking on the arrow next to the `save session` button and see complete list using the button at the bottom of this list.

- To make organization and recall easier, tag your sessions by clicking the `tag` icon that shows on hover of a session list item. Add a name that provides information to other team members about the use of that session.
