<Steps>
<Step title="Build your chain">

Create a Prompt Chain by connecting Prompt, Code, and API nodes based on your data flow. Each node type handles a specific task in your AI workflow.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure your test">

Test your chain against a [Dataset](/library/how-to/datasets/use-dataset-templates) and add [Evaluators](/library/how-to/evaluators/use-pre-built-evaluators) to measure the quality of outputs. Configure any additional parameters needed for your test run.

</Step>

<Step title="Review results">

Analyze the test report for quality metrics like accuracy and performance metrics like latency and cost. Use these insights to iterate on your chain.
