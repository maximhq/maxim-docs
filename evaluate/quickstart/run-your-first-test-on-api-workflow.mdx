<Steps>
<Step title="Configure your HTTP endpoint">

Set up your API endpoint in the [Workflows](/evaluate/concepts#workflows) section. Add request headers and body parameters as needed. Transform requests using optional pre/post scripts for advanced configurations.

</Step>

<Step title="Set up test parameters">

Select a [Dataset](/evaluate/concepts#datasets) containing your test cases and add [Evaluators](/evaluate/concepts#evaluators) to assess response quality. Combine evaluators to measure accuracy, toxicity, and other metrics that matter to you.
