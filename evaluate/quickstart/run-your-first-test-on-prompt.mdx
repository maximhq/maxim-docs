<Steps>
<Step title="Create and publish a Prompt">

Start by creating a new [Prompt](/docs/evaluate/how-to/evaluate-prompts/experiment-in-prompt-playground) in the playground. Configure your messages and settings, then [publish the version](/docs/evaluate/how-to/evaluate-prompts/create-prompt-versions) when you're ready for testing.

</Step>
<Step title="Configure and trigger a test">

Choose a [Dataset](/docs/library/how-to/datasets/use-dataset-templates) with your test cases and add [Evaluators](/docs/library/how-to/evaluators/use-pre-built-evaluators) to measure response quality. You can mix and match evaluators to check for accuracy, toxicity, and more.

</Step>
<Step title="Review test results">

Once the test is complete, you'll get a comprehensive report to understand your Prompt's performance. You'll see:

- Overall quality scores across your test cases
- Which inputs performed best and worst
- Side-by-side comparisons of expected vs. actual outputs
- Detailed evaluator feedback on specific responses

This helps you quickly identify where your Prompt shines and where it needs improvement.
