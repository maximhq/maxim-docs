description: "Let's see how you can integrate Maxim into OpenAI Agents SDK"
---

## Requirements

```
"openai>=1.65.4"
"maxim-py>=3.5.0"
```

## Env variables

```
MAXIM_API_KEY=
MAXIM_LOG_REPO_ID=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

## **Customer service agent**

Taken from [OpenAI Agents Example Folder](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/examples/customer_service/main.py).

Flow:

1. **User Input**: The user asks a question or makes a request.
2. **Triage Agent**: This agent first handles the input, figuring out what the user needs and deciding which specialized agent should take over.
3. **Specialized Agents**: Based on the request, the Triage Agent may pass the conversation to either the FAQ Agent or the Seat Booking Agent.
   - **FAQ Agent**: Answers common questions using a predefined tool.
   - **Seat Booking Agent**: Manages seat booking requests and updates seat information.
4. **Context Update**: The system updates the context (like flight number, seat number, etc.) based on the user's input and the actions taken by the agents.
5. **Logging/Tracing**: All interactions and updates are logged and traced using the Maxim SDK for monitoring and analysis.
6. **Output**: The final response is generated and sent back to the user.

This system ensures that user requests are efficiently routed to the right agent, and all interactions are tracked for quality and performance monitoring.

### **Initializing Maxim SDK**

- Maxim SDK picks up `MAXIM_API_KEY` and `MAXIM_LOG_REPO_ID` from environment variables.
- You can pass them as parameters if you would like to.
- Learn more [here](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/observe/concepts#log-repository).

```python
from agents import add_trace_processor
from maxim import Maxim
from maxim.logger.openai.agents import MaximOpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor
# Creating a new logger instance
# It automatically initializes using MAXIM_API_KEY and MAXIM_LOG_REPO_ID from env variables.

logger = Maxim().logger()
add_trace_processor(MaximOpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor(logger))
```

### **Run agent**

```python
current_agent: Agent[AirlineAgentContext] = triage_agent
input_items: list[TResponseInputItem] = []
context = AirlineAgentContext()

# Normally, each input from the user would be an API request to your app, and you can wrap the request in a trace()
# Here, we'll just use a random UUID for the conversation ID
conversation_id = uuid.uuid4().hex[:16]

user_input = "Whats the max allowed baggage"
input_items.append({"content": user_input, "role": "user"})
result = await Runner.run(current_agent, input_items, context=context)
for new_item in result.new_items:
    agent_name = new_item.agent.name
    if isinstance(new_item, MessageOutputItem):
        print(f"{agent_name}: {ItemHelpers.text_message_output(new_item)}")
    elif isinstance(new_item, HandoffOutputItem):
        print(
            f"Handed off from {new_item.source_agent.name} to {new_item.target_agent.name}"
        )
    elif isinstance(new_item, ToolCallItem):
        print(f"{agent_name}: Calling a tool")
    elif isinstance(new_item, ToolCallOutputItem):
        print(f"{agent_name}: Tool call output: {new_item.output}")
    else:
        print(f"{agent_name}: Skipping item: {new_item.__class__.__name__}")
```

```
Triage Agent: Skipping item: HandoffCallItem
Handed off from Triage Agent to FAQ Agent
FAQ Agent: Calling a tool
FAQ Agent: Tool call output: You are allowed to bring one bag on the plane. It must be under 50 pounds and 22 inches x 14 inches x 9 inches.
FAQ Agent: You are allowed to bring one bag on the plane, which must be under 50 pounds and measure 22 inches x 14 inches x 9 inches.
```

# **Maxim dashboard**

You can view the trace of the agents' interactions on the [Maxim](https://www.getmaxim.ai/) dashboard, which provides detailed insights and visualizations of the entire process.
