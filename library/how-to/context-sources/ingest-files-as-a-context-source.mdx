Maxim allows you to upload various document formats (.pdf, .docx, .csv, .txt, .md) and automatically creates embeddings for use as context in your applications.

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the Context Sources section in your workspace and click on the Plus icon.
</Step>

<Step>
Select "Files" as your context source type.
</Step>

<Step>
Drag and drop your files or click "Browse files" and select files from your system.
Supported formats:
- PDF documents (.pdf)
- Word documents (.docx)
- CSV files (.csv)
- Text files (.txt)
- Markdown files (.md)
</Step>

<Step>
Wait for the files to upload and for embeddings to be generated. The status indicator will show progress.
</Step>

<Step>
Once processing is complete, your files are ready to be used as context. You can now reference this context source in agent simulation.
