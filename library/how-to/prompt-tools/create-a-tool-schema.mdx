title: Create a Schema-based Prompt Tool
description: Schema-based prompt tools provide a structured way to define tools that ensure accurate and schema-compliant outputs. This approach is particularly useful when you need to guarantee that the LLM's responses follow a specific format.

## Creating a Schema Tool

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the **Prompt Tools** section and click the + button.
</Step>

<Step>
Select **Schema** as the tool type.
</Step>

<Step>
Define your schema in the editor. Here's an example schema for a stock price tool:

```json title="Function call schema"
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get-stock-price",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "stock": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            }
        },
        "description": "this function returns stock value"
    }
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
Click the **Save** button to create your schema-based tool.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Your Schema Tool

After creating your schema-based tool:
1. Add it to a prompt configuration
2. Test if the model correctly identifies when to use it
3. Verify that the outputs match your schema's structure
