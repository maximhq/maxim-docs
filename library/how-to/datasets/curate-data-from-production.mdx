<Steps>

    <Step>
    Select the logs from your log repository (preferably where you push your production data) and click on the `Add to Dataset` button in the top right corner.

    </Step>

    <Step>
    Next, you'll see a dialog where you can either choose an existing Dataset or create a new one. Let's create a fresh Dataset for this example.
    You can use one of our templates (we'll use "Dataset testing") or create a custom structure. Click the `Create Dataset` button when ready.

    </Step>

    <Step>
    Now it's time to map your log columns to Dataset columns. In this example, we're mapping the Input field to the Dataset's Input column and Output to the Output column. Once you've set up your mappings, click "Add to Dataset".

    </Step>

    <Step>
    That's it! You'll receive a notification when your Dataset is ready. Simply click the `Open Dataset` button to start working with your newly created Dataset.
