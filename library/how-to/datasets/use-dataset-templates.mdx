title: Create a Dataset using templates
description: Datasets are collections of data used for training, testing, and evaluating AI models within workflows and evaluations. Test your prompts, workflows or chains across test cases in this dataset and view results at scale. Begin with a template and customize column structure. Evolve your datasets over time from production logs or human annotation.

Create Datasets quickly with predefined structures using our templates:

![Dataset templates showing three template options for different testing scenarios](/images/docs/library/how-to/datasets/use-dataset-templates/dataset-templates.png)

## Prompt or Workflow testing
Choose this template for single-turn interactions based on individual inputs to test prompts or workflows.

**Example:** Input column with prompts like "Summarize this article about climate change" paired with an Expected Output column containing ideal responses.

## Agent simulation
Select this template for multi-turn simulations to test agent behaviors across conversation sequences.

**Example:** Scenario column with "Customer inquiring about return policy" and Expected Steps column outlining the agent's expected actions.

## Dataset testing
Use this template when evaluating against existing output data to compare expected and actual results.

**Example:** Input column with "What's the weather in New York?" and Expected Output column with "65Â°F and sunny" for direct evaluation.
