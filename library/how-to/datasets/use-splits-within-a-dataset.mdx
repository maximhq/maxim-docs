Splits let you isolate specific rows from a dataset for targeted testing. Here's how to use them:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    In your Dataset, select the rows you want to include in a split. Click the `Add x entries to split` button that appears.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    Attach your split to a test run for evaluation:

    <Note>
      Splits function just like Datasets across the platform and can be used with Prompts, Workflows, and other testing features.
