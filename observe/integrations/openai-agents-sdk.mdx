The [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) enables you to build agentic AI apps in a lightweight, easy-to-use package with very few abstractions. It's a production-ready upgrade of our previous experimentation for agents, Swarm. The Agents SDK has a very small set of primitives:

- **Agents**, which are LLMs equipped with instructions and tools
- **Handoffs**, which allow agents to delegate to other agents for specific tasks
- **Guardrails**, which enable the inputs to agents to be validated

## Integrating with Maxim

<Steps>
				<Step title="Create account">
		Create a Maxim account and a Log repository. Follow the instructions in the [quickstart
		section](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/observe/quickstart).
	</Step>
	<Step title="Install SDK">
	Install Maxim SDK

    			```bash
    			pip install maxim-py
    			```
    			</Step>
    			<Step title="Set the following environment variables to configure the Maxim SDK">       
    					| Environment Variable | Description |
    					| --- | --- |
    					| `MAXIM_API_KEY` | Your Maxim API key |
    					| `MAXIM_LOG_REPO_ID` | ID of the log repository to use |

    					And then Maxim SDK will automatically initialize using these env variables.

```python
from maxim import Maxim,Config
from maxim.logger.openai.agents import MaximOpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor
# Creating a new logger instance
# It automatically initializes using MAXIM_API_KEY and MAXIM_LOG_REPO_ID from env variables.
logger = Maxim(Config()).logger()
```

    			</Step>
    			<Step title="Manually initialize OR you can manually initialize the SDK">    				

```python
from maxim import Maxim,Config
from maxim.logger import LoggerConfig

logger = Maxim(Config(api_key="your_api_key")).logger(LoggerConfig(id="your_log_repo_id"))
```

    			</Step>
    			<Step title="Add tracing processor">
    					Add the `MaximOpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor` to your agent using `add_trace_processor` or `set_trace_processor`.

```python
from agents import add_trace_processor
from maxim.logger.openai.agents import MaximOpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor

add_trace_processor(MaximOpenAIAgentsTracingProcessor(logger))

# Your agent code
```

    			</Step>

</Steps>

## Cookbooks

Here are a few cookbooks that you can use to get started with Maxim:
