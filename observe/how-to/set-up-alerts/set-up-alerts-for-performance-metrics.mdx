Monitor your application's performance by setting up alerts for latency, token usage, and cost metrics. Create custom thresholds and receive notifications when metrics exceed your specified limits.

## Available metrics

Set up alerts for:

- **Latency**: Response times for API calls
- **Token Usage**: Token consumption per request
- **Cost**: API usage expenses

## Create an alert

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to repository">
Open the Logs page and select your repository
</Step>
<Step title="Access alerts tab">
Select the **Alerts** tab and click **Create alert**
</Step>
<Step title="Configure alert settings">
  - Select **Log metrics** as the type of alert
  - Select a metric (Latency, Token Usage, or Cost)
  - Choose an operator (greater than, less than)
  - Enter the threshold value
  - Set minimum occurrence count
  - Define evaluation time range
</Step>
<Step title="Select notification channels">
Select your preferred notification channels (Slack, or PagerDuty)
</Step>
<Step title="Save your alert">
Click **Create alert**
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common alert configurations" or "Alert configuration examples

### Monitor response time
```
Metric: Latency
Operator: greater than
Threshold: 1000 ms
Minimum occurrences: 5
Time range: 5 minutes
```
Triggers when response time exceeds 1 second in 5 requests within 5 minutes.

### Setting up token consumption alerts
```
Metric: Token Usage
Operator: greater than
Threshold: 1000000
Minimum occurrences: 1
Time range: 1 hour
```
Triggers when hourly token usage exceeds 1 million.

### Monitor daily costs
```
Metric: Cost
Operator: greater than
Threshold: 100 USD
Minimum occurrences: 1
Time range: 24 hours
```
Triggers when daily costs exceed $100.

## Manage alerts

- **Edit**: Click the options menu (three dots) > Edit alert
- **Delete**: Click the options menu > Delete alert
- **Pause/Resume**: Click the options menu > Pause alert or Resume alert

## Best practices

1. Begin with conservative thresholds to avoid alert fatigue
2. Match time ranges to your application's usage patterns
3. Use multiple occurrence thresholds for latency alerts to prevent false alarms
4. Create layered alerts with different thresholds for comprehensive monitoring
