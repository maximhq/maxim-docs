description: Track application milestones and state changes using event logging

Create events to mark specific points in time during your application execution. Capture additional metadata such as intermediate states and system milestones through events.

<div className="w-full flex justify-end -mb-11">

    await trace.event({
        id: "event-id",
        name: "travel-plan-emailed",
        tags: { "email": "JetSetJoe@travelo.com" },
    });
    ```

    ```python Python
    await trace.event(
        id="event-id",
        name="travel-plan-emailed",
        tags={"email": "JetSetJoe@travelo.com"}
    )
    ```

    ```go Go
    trace.AddEvent(
        "event-id",
        "travel-plan-emailed",
        map[string]string{"email": "JetSetJoe@travelo.com"}
    )
    ```

    ```java Java
    Event event = trace.addEvent(
        "event-id",
        "travel-plan-emailed",
        Map.of("email", "JetSetJoe@travelo.com")
    );
    ```
