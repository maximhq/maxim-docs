Our advanced evaluation and observability tools help teams maintain quality, reliability, and speed throughout the AI application lifecycle.

![Overview](/images/docs/introduction/overview.png)

## 1. Experiment

We have a Playground++ built for advanced prompt engineering, enabling rapid iteration, deployment, and experimentation.

- Organize and version their prompts effectively
- Deploy prompts with different deployment variables and experimentation strategies without code changes
- Connect with databases, RAG pipelines, and prompt tools seamlessly
- Simplify decision-making by comparing output quality, cost, and latency across various combinations of prompts, models, and parameters

## 2. Evaluate

Our unified framework for machine and human evaluations allows you to quantify improvements or regressions and deploy with confidence.

- Access a variety of off-the-shelf evaluators through the evaluator store
- Create custom evaluators suited to specific application needs
- Measure quality of prompts or workflows quantitatively using AI, programmatic, or statistical evaluators
- Visualize evaluation runs on large test suites across multiple versions of prompts or workflows
- Human evaluations can be conducted for last-mile quality checks and nuanced assessments

## 3. Observe

The observability suite empowers you to monitor real-time production logs and run them through periodic quality checks to ensure production quality.

- Create multiple repositories for multiple apps for your production data that can be logged and analyzed using distributed tracing
- Live issues can be tracked, debugged, and resolved quickly
- In-production quality can be measured using automated evaluations based on custom rules
- Datasets can be curated with ease for evaluation and fine-tuning needs

## 4. Data engine

Seamless data management for AI applications allows users to curate and enrich multi-modal datasets easily for evaluation and fine-tuning needs.

- Import datasets, including images, with a few clicks
- Continuously curate and evolve datasets from production data
- Enrich data using in-house or Maxim-managed data labeling and feedback
- Create data splits for targeted evaluations and experiments
