title: Overview
description: Maxim offers self hosting and flexible enterprise deployment options with either full VPC isolation (Zero Touch) or hybrid setup with secure VPC peering (Data Plane), tailored to your security needs.
---

## Zero Touch Deployment

We set up both the data plane and control plane directly in your VPC.
This ensures that your data stays completely within your infrastructure, with no data exchange between your VPC and our cloud services.

## Data Plane Deployment

We deploy only the data plane in your VPC, which connects to our cloud-hosted application plane through secure VPC peering.
Each deployment type is designed to meet different security and integration needs. Let's explore the details of each option.

## Maxim infrastructure

To better understand these deployment options, let's examine the key components of our infrastructure:

![infrastructure](/images/docs/invpc/architecture.png)


### Control plane

The control plane encompasses all applications that handle the business logic and user experience. Web service and serverless functions are exposed to internet via a load balancer.

#### Components

| Component | Description | Language |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Web service | Dashboard + APIs | TypeScript |
| AI-Stack | Proprietary evaluators | Python |
| Workers | Real-time log processing, evaluation, and alerts | Go |
| Serverless functions | SDK APIs | Go |



### Data plane

The data plane encompasses all components that handle data at rest and in transit. We utilize secure VPC peering (where required) to connect to control plane.

#### Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Dragonfly | In-memory key-value store |
| Kafka | Queue for real-time log processing |
| BigQuery/Redshift | Data lake |
| Clickhouse | OLAP database for logs and evaluations |
| MySQL | OLTP database |
| Firestore/DocumentDB | Used as a vector database |

## Pillars of Maxim's Infrastructure

### Infra as code

- We deploy our infrastructure using Terraform.
- All the images are securely hosted and fingerprinted by customer-specific keys for every version.
- Our infra as code is available for review by the customer.

### Cloud provider support

- We manage the orchestration of the infrastructure using Kubernetes.
- We support GCP and AWS cloud providers.


### Security measures

- We attach a cloud-native security layer to ingress (Cloud Armor on GCP, AWS WAF, etc.).
- We have pre-defined configurations vetted by our security team for every cloud provider.
- The k8s cluster is deployed in a separate VPC.
- We use cloud-native MySQL for storage with encryption at rest.
- All outgoing traffic is routed through a cloud-native internet gateway.
